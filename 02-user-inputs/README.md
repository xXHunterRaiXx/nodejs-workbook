# Dog Age Calculator

## Introduction

In this lab, you will be creating a small Node.js app that can take in input on the command line and give the user the answer they're looking for.

## Goal

When you're done, you'll have a small command-line app that other developers can download and run.

## Resources

Here is an article quickly summarizing `process.argv`:

## Dog Age Calculator

It's not _actually_ true that 1 dog year is 7 human years. Nor is the calculation we'll follow _quite_ right—to get a truly accurate picture of a dog's age, you need to take their size into account as well.

But for the purposes of this assignment, you will calculate a dog's real age with the following rules:

- Year 1 of a dog's life is 15 dog years
- Year 2 is the equivalent of another 9 years.
- Every year after that is the equivalent of another 5 years.

Some ages to try to make sure your app works:

- 1 human year -> 15 dog years
- 2 human years -> 24 dog years
- 10 human years -> 64 dog years

Your app will work with a dog's name and age in human years, and return a sentence about their age in dog years. 

You can assume the user will enter whole numbers greater than 0 for the dog's age. 

## Test Cases
Run the following test cases to ensure your dog age calculator is running correctly. 

Running `node index.js Maisie 3` should output: "Your dog, Maisie, is 3 years old, but that's 29 years old in dog years!"

Similarly, running `node index.js Ralph 4` should output, "Your dog, Ralph, is 4 years old, but that's 34 years old in dog years!"

## Bonus challenge (optional) 
After you've gotten your app up and running, think through all the different error handling you'd want to do, and implement error handling into your app. 

So if the user inputs 7.5 for the dog's age, would you round that number up?

Or if someone enters a string instead of a number, do you want to have a way to handle that error that sends a message back to the user, or in this case, logs an error message to the console? For example, you could say, "Please enter a number."
