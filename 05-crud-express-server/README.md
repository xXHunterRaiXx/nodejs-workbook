# Web Server Codealong

## Introduction

This codealong is for a book API that will use CRUD operations to manipulate the book data in the `data.json` file.

Your task is to build out the `index.js` file to run as a web server, handling incoming GET and POST requests, as well as accessing and manipulating the JSON file.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: For the purposes of this exercise, all endpoints use the `GET` method, including those that would typically use `POST`, `DELETE` or `PUT` in a real-world API.

## Steps to Create a Node/Express Server

1. In your project folder, run `npm init -y`
2. Install Express: `npm install express`
3. Create a `.gitignore` file and add `node_modules` to ignore that folder.
4. Create a `src` folder to hold your code. Inside it, create `index.js`.
5. In `index.js`, import all required Node modules (such as `express`)
6. Add the Express boilerplate: create the app instance, define the port, and start the listener.
7. Define API routes and any helper functions needed to read or modify `data.json`.
